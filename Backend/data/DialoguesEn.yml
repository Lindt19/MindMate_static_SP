    - "<p>I'm glad you asked that. I was programmed to help you write great reflective texts by providing you with constructive feedback. &#128522;</p>
          <p> It is important to keep the overall structure of your essay in mind. You can learn more about this in the theory.
          <p> Often students simply forget to consciously use positive/negative or subjective elements in their essays. Your essay can become too one-sided by being too positive or negative, or it can become too subjective or objective.
                            I help you to keep track of both areas and thus build a good and balanced reflective structure so that you can achieve your desired goal! &#128521; </p>

    - Introduction
    - "<p>Hello, I am MindMate. I will assist you in improving your reflective writings.</p>
      <p>For this purpose, we will go over some essential theoretical concepts together,
      and I'll also show you how to structure your reflections in your writing.</p>
      <p>To start reflecting, you have two options: Either a 'static' one where you will enter you reflective text and have general feedback
      or an 'interactive' version for a more dynamic conversation where I can provide guidelines and a more adaptive feedback. You can choose
      one of the two options by clicking on the corresponding buttons bellow </p>
    <p>I am still in training, but I will do my best to help you! Try using the buttons to navigate through the learning environment. &#128515; </p>

    - How is the sentiment measured?
    - "<p>There are a variety of methods used to measure sentiment by different researchers in the field.</p>
           <p>Sentiment analysis (also called opinion mining) uses natural language processing, text analysis and other linguistic tools to identify, analyse, structure and categorise a given text. This includes categorising the strength of opinion and objectivity, both of which form the overall mood of the text. &#128209;</p>

    - How can I improve my reflections?
    - "<p>Reflecting effectively is a skill that can be developed and improved over time. Here are some tips for students to enhance their reflection abilities:</p>
    <p>Ask probing questions: Instead of simply recounting what happened, go deeper by asking yourself thought-provoking questions. </p>
    <p>Be honest and open: Reflecting requires honesty and self-awareness. Be open to acknowledging both the positive and negative aspects of the experience, as well as your own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
    <p>Practice self-reflection regularly: Make reflection a habit by setting aside dedicated time for introspection. Consider journaling, meditation, or having meaningful conversations with mentors or peers to facilitate the reflection process. </p>
    <p>Use a structured framework: Utilize reflection frameworks or models such as Gibbs' Reflective Cycle, Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle, or Bloom's Taxonomy of Reflection. These frameworks provide a structure to guide your reflection process and ensure a comprehensive analysis. </p>

    - Start the evaluation process
    - "<p>I would like to briefly explain how MindMate analyses your reflective essay. </p>
              <p>To analyse and score your essay, you need to type the whole essay into the text box that appears when you click on ''Open text box''.
   <p>Your task: <i> Reflect on a recent accomplishment and explore the factors that contributed to your success. </i> </p>
   <p><b>Please write a text of 250 to 300 words. If you need more information on the structure feel free to ask more clarifications </b></p>

     <p>  Please ensure that your final essay is entered in full in the text box. This is important so that you get a complete analysis of the whole essay. If you only analyse a few paragraphs, you will get an incomplete overview of your essay.
              After you have received the results, you can improve your essay according to the results. If you need help in certain areas, I am happy to help you. &#128522; </p>

    - Could you elaborate more on the structure of reflective texts?
    - "<p>Yes, of course! I can go into further detail by explaining to you the structure of a reflective essay.</p>
           <p>These are the common elements that are typically included in a reflective text: </p>
           <p>Introduction: The introduction should provide context and background information about the topic or experience that the author is reflecting on. It may also include a thesis statement that outlines the main points or ideas that the author will explore in the text.</p>
           <p>Body: The body of the reflective text typically includes several paragraphs that explore the author's thoughts, feelings, and experiences related to the topic. These paragraphs may include personal anecdotes, examples, or evidence to support the author's ideas. </p>
           <p>Analysis: In this section, the author should analyze and reflect on their experiences and how they have impacted their understanding of the topic. This section should also address any challenges or difficulties that the author faced and how they overcame them. </p>
           <p>Conclusion: The conclusion should summarize the main points and ideas of the reflective text and provide a final reflection on the topic or experience. The author may also offer suggestions for future action or additional reflection.</p>

    - Why is reflective journaling useful in learning processes?
    - "<p> By reflecting on what happened and why, individuals can develop their critical thinking skills and gain a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them.
     Individuals can identify their strengths and weaknesses, values, and beliefs, which can help them make better decisions and develop new skills and strategies in the future.
     It also provides a record of an individual's progress over time.</p>
